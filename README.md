Formula 1 World Drivers Championship Clinch Analyzer

This is a jupyter notebook just for fun that I've coded while watching the races.

Currently it calculates the maximum drivers and constructors place that drivers and constructors can get based on maximum points if the teams get the top place.

Then it calculates the lowest place a driver and constructor can get based on total available cumulative points, and then total points available per position.

It isn't 100% accurate, but it's close.  If the validation column is false, then it's accurate, but where it's true, it needs manual review to determine if places were allocated differently, whether finishing in the bottom place is actually possible.

I'm going to add functionality as the races go on, and try and improve it.  If you have any thoughts or changes you would suggest, I'm open to it.  It's just for fun :)
